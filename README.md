## Hi there ðŸ‘‹




Hello! I'm a Software Engineer based in Amsterdam, passionate about creating innovative solutions and writing clean, efficient code. I hold a degree from the University of Amsterdam of Applied Sciences, where I honed my skills and developed a strong foundation in software engineering.

Over the years, I have had the privilege of working in three dynamic startups, each providing unique challenges and opportunities for growth. These experiences have equipped me with a versatile skill set and a deep understanding of the startup ecosystem. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life.
